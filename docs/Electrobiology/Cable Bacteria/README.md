# Cable Bacteria
Cable bacteria are filamentous bacteria that can conduct electrons over centimeter-scale distances, enabling them to couple spatially separated redox reactions in sedimentary environments. They play a crucial role in biogeochemical cycling, particularly in the oxidation of sulfide and the reduction of oxygen or nitrate.
